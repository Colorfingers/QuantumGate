# QuantumGate Code of Conduct

We believe freedom of speech to be a fundamental requirement for open and clear
communication, learning and enlightenment. 

We do not believe in censorship. We do not believe in 'professional' and
'politically correct' behavior. We invite everyone to truthfully speak their
minds without fear and without self-censorship.

We do not accept responsibility for others. Every individual speaks for
themselves. Every individual bears responsibility for their own behavior.
